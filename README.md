# 🚗 Car Price Prediction

This project predicts the selling price of cars based on multiple features like age, mileage, fuel type, engine capacity, and more. It uses Machine Learning Regression models to analyze patterns and provide accurate price estimates.

# 📌 Features

📊 Predicts car price from input features.

🔍 Performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.

🧠 Uses regression models (Linear Regression / Multiple Regression).

📈 Evaluates model performance using metrics like R², MAE, MSE.

☁️ Implemented in Google Colab for easy execution.

# ⚙️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy → Data processing

Matplotlib, Seaborn → Data visualization

Scikit-learn → Machine Learning (Linear Regression, train/test split, evaluation)

Google Colab → Development environment

# 🚀 Workflow

Data Collection → Load dataset (CSV / Excel).

Data Preprocessing → Handle missing values, encode categorical variables.

EDA → Study correlations, distributions, scatter plots.

Model Training → Train regression model(s).

Evaluation → Check performance with R², MSE, MAE.

Prediction → Input car details → Get predicted price.
